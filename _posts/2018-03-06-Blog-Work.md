This week we worked on our blogs just trying to make sure that they were working and fixing our problems. I talked to my teacher about what was going wrong with my blog, as it was not publishing but it did not give a reason. So in the end we decided I should restart my blog and completely delete it and use a different repository. This lesson was also for fixing your virtual shops if there was anything else you still had to add, however I did not do that as i had to restart my blog and that would take a while to set up.
