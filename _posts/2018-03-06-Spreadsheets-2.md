This week we carried on making our spreadsheets better and just generally improving them. The main improvement was adding discounts to our spreadsheet. We had a cell which was labeled discount and in the cell next to it whatever percentage you put in, is what discount the customer would get off of their purchase. However there were other types of discounts that we could do. For example you could make a meal deal discount, where you made a cell that had an "IF" formula in it, as well as an “AND”. So if a customer bought a specific item and another item it would apply a discount to their overall purchase. Or you could use “IF” to say if they bought more than a certain amount of items, they would get a discount, however to do this you would need to reference a cell that adds all of the items the customer is buying so you could change than whenever you wanted and the discount would still work if it should.
