This week we had a cover lesson so our work was posted on the google classroom. We were told to look at our teachers blog and fix our blogs if they had any problems. I got some of my problems fixed, such as how sometimes if I did not put a quantity in I would get an error in some of my cells, but then I put ",false" at the end of one of my cells and it fixed it.
