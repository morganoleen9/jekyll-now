This year we started I.T. with a new teacher and i learned a lot in this lesson. We were introduced to google sheets, a spreadsheet application very similar to Microsoft Excel if you are more familiar with that. We are starting to make a virtual shop in our spreadsheet, or at least something a would be shop owner or worker could use in order to keep track of stock, sales, etc. We made a shopping list, with lots of us having very questionable stock, and assigned prices to them by writing the price in the next column. We also had a system where you could put in a number in a box next to the price which was the quantity, and this would then multiply this by the price to get the overall price of what the customer has to pay for those items. Because we did not want to write this for every box, we learned that by grabbing the small blue square in the corner of a cell you could drag it to other cells and that would bring the formula to those cells. This was very useful and was a good start to I.T. in Yr 9
