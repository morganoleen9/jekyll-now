This week we learned how to make caesar ciphers in a spreadsheet where you have the alphabet and then move the alphabet down a few letters or more in a column next to it. You then use VLOOKUP to find which letter relates to which and therefore you can translate codes which are in a caesar cipher. To do this you have to put each letter in an individual cell so to read the whole word easily you can use CONCATENATE to put all of the letters together into one word.
