This week we had our last I.T. lesson on virtual shop spreadsheets. We learned about how you can have multiple sheets on one spreadsheet and you can reference cells from one to cells to another, by also putting in which sheet you need. This means you can have all of your ugly looking cells and workings out in one sheet and have just what you need to plug in and the information you need in another sheet so you it can look nicer. I think overall this has really helped me with spreadsheets and I am much more confident I could make a spreadsheet if i needed to.
