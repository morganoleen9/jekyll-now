This lesson we had a new teacher, and we started to learn about python more by using a website called repl.it. This website has a way of learning python which is called python with turtle. This gives you a cursor on a result screen that you can control, which will draw if you move it. We figured out as a class how to make it give us a square, which includes telling the turtle to move forward, turn 90 degrees and then repeating that four times. Eventually we made this easier by defining a formula to make our cursor do this, and then edited it to make whatever shape we want. Our homework was to make something funky and this is demonstrated by the screenshot below.
